3. Bundle optimization:

   - Analyze bundle size with webpack-bundle-analyzer
   - Identify and remove unused dependencies
   - Implement code splitting for large components
   - Optimize asset loading

4. Runtime performance:

   - Optimize animations for performance
   - Reduce DOM operations
   - Implement virtualization for long lists
   - Add performance monitoring

5. Mobile optimization:
   - Reduce JavaScript execution on mobile
   - Optimize touch event handling
   - Reduce battery consumption
   - Implement responsive image loading

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Application renders efficiently without unnecessary re-renders
- State updates are optimized to prevent cascading renders
- Bundle size is minimized for faster loading
- Application performs well on lower-end devices
- Performance metrics meet the following targets:
  - First contentful paint < 1.5s
  - Time to interactive < 3s
  - No frame drops during animations
  - Smooth scrolling and interactions

**Testing Instructions:**

1. Use React DevTools Profiler to identify render issues
2. Measure bundle size before and after optimization
3. Test on lower-end devices
4. Run Lighthouse performance audit
5. Test with throttled CPU and network

**Dependencies:**

- Should be done after major functional work is complete
- May require additional performance monitoring tools

## How to Use This File

This JIRA tasks file serves multiple purposes:

1. **Task Tracking**: Use the checkboxes in the Progress Tracking section to mark tasks as complete
2. **Implementation Guide**: Each task specification provides detailed requirements for implementation
3. **Quality Assurance**: Testing instructions ensure consistent verification of completed work
4. **Documentation**: This file documents the planned architecture and implementation details
5. **Project Management**: Priority and dependency information helps with scheduling work

To update progress:

1. Mark tasks as complete by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]` and updating the percentage
2. Update the overall project completion percentage
3. Add notes to individual tasks as they progress
4. Review dependencies before starting new tasks

## Development Workflow

1. Select a task based on priority and dependencies
2. Create a feature branch for the task: `feature/task-name`
3. Implement according to the specifications
4. Write tests as specified in testing instructions
5. Update this file with progress
6. Create a pull request for review
7. Merge after approval and update overall progress
